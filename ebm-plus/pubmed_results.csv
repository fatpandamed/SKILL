"41548748","Recognition of esophageal intubation in Dutch prehospital emergency medical services using capnography analysis: a retrospective cohort study.","Unrecognized esophageal intubation during prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) leads to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation and often results in death. This study describes and analyzes, using mathematical calculations, how esophageal capnography differs from normal capnography in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients, in order to assess whether these differences could support future detection. We conducted a retrospective analysis using the Rotterdam Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) database from January 2015 to November 2024. Cases of unrecognized esophageal intubation after ground EMS airway management were identified and analyzed for capnography waveform patterns before and after HEMS reintubation. HEMS data were supplemented with ambulance and monitor data from the Corpuls Manager database. Capnography waveforms were manually annotated and analyzed for CO  levels, trend, area under the curve, and upslope. Out of 5830 cases with intubation prior or during HEMS deployment, 92 were identified as esophageal intubations, with 14 cases involving OHCA in our region of interest with usable capnography. The median maximal esophageal CO  was 2.5 kPa, and the median maximal tracheal CO  was 10.8 kPa. Esophageal intubations showed a downward trend approaching near-zero values of CO  within eight ventilations. Significant differences were found in the median corrected area under the curve and median upslope between esophageal and tracheal intubations. This study uses analysis of waveform morphology to distinguish esophageal from tracheal intubation. While etCO  values can appear numerically similar, the waveform morphology differs significantly. These findings represent an important first step toward developing automated tools for detecting inadequate ventilation by esophageal intubation. Larger datasets and prospective validation are needed before clinical implementation."
"40952743","Advanced Airway Devices and End-Tidal Capnography Trends in Cardiac Arrest: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.","While variable advanced airway devices are used in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resuscitation, potential differences in ventilation metrics are not well known. To characterize differences in end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) capnography trajectories between laryngeal tube (LT) and endotracheal intubation (ETI) during OHCA. This secondary analysis of EtCO2 capnography waveforms from the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial (PART), a multicenter cluster-crossover randomized clinical trial, was performed November 1, 2023, through July 8, 2025. Participants in this analysis were adults (aged ≥18 years) with nontraumatic OHCA from 27 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies, which were placed into 13 clusters. Participants were assigned to LT or ETI airway management. All cases with 50% or greater interpretable EtCO2 signal were included. LT vs ETI airway management. Mean maximal EtCO2 values within 1-minute epochs and trends over resuscitation after LT or ETI. Associations with OHCA outcomes were also evaluated, including sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 72-hour survival. Using the Mann-Whitney test, EtCO2 of LT and ETI cases were compared at 20-, 10-, and 1-minute resuscitation. EtCO2 trends over time were evaluated using Cochran-Armitage test of trend. Covariates in multivariable logistic regression models for outcomes were adjusted, including interaction between advanced airway device and EtCO2 trends. Of the 3004 cases in PART, 1113 (818 in LT and 295 in ETI groups) had available EtCO2 data and were included in the secondary analysis. Patients were mostly male (694 [62.4%]), had a median (IQR) age of 64 (52-75) years, and had a nonshockable (941 [84.6%]), nonpublic (999 [89.8%]) OHCA. ROSC occurred in 144 patients (17.6%) receiving LT and 54 (18.3%) receiving ETI. EtCO2 values did not differ between LT and ETI groups (20-minute resuscitation: 33.9 vs 29.4 mm Hg, P = .07; 10-minute resuscitation: 30.9 vs 28.5 mm Hg, P = .89; 1-minute resuscitation: 32.2 vs 28.3 mm Hg, P = .28). In ROSC compared with non-ROSC cases, patients in LT (27.9 to 52.3 mm Hg vs 32.6 to 23.5 mm Hg; P < .001) and ETI (38.2 to 46.7 mm Hg vs 27.7 to 20.0 mm Hg; P < .001) groups exhibited increasing EtCO2 during resuscitation. EtCO2 trend and advanced airway interaction was associated with ROSC (odds ratio [OR], 1.75; 95% CI, 1.25-2.45) but not survival (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.90-1.61). Therefore, we performed an advanced airway stratified analysis for ROSC (ETI: OR, 2.34 [95% CI, 1.67-3.26]; LT: OR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.20-1.47]). In this secondary analysis of PART, EtCO2 values did not differ between LT and ETI. However, due to significant interaction between advanced airway device and EtCO2 trends, individual interpretation of these parameters may not be accurate."
"40800008","System.Xml.XmlElement","An increase in both regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO ) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO ) during advanced life support for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is associated with a higher likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and may predict neurological outcome. However, it remains unclear which marker is more predictive for which outcome parameter. In this prospective observational study, we assessed rSO  and etCO  in patients treated for OHCA in the metropolitan area of Vienna between 05/2017 and 02/2022. Follow-up was performed for survival and neurological performance at hospital discharge and at six and 12 months after OHCA. rSO  and etCO  were compared between individuals with favourable and unfavourable outcomes, and cut-off values using ROC analyses were identified. Median rSO  and etCO  values of the included 176 patients during CPR were higher in those achieving sustained ROSC (rSO : 59 % (IQR 16.1) vs 46 % (IQR 14.3), p < 0.001; etCO : 40 (IQR 18.7) vs. 25 (IQR 20.9) mmHg, p < 0.001) and in patients with cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2 (rSO : 66 % (IQR 15.5) vs 48 % (IQR 14.8), p < 0.001; etCO : 50 (IQR 16.1) vs. 28 mmHg, p = 0.013). ROC analysis for median rSO  values yielded an optimal cutoff of 60 % (sensitivity 86 %, specificity 87 %) for CPC 1/2, and for median etCO  values 49 mmHg (sensitivity 67 %, specificity 94 %) for CPC 1/2. In ROC analyses, etCO  trends achieved better results for sustained ROSC prediction than rSO . In contrast, rSO  outperformed etCO  for the prediction of neurological outcome. Measuring RSO  and etCO  during advanced life support is associated with critical clinical outcomes. Our findings suggest that these two parameters reflect different physiological aspects of resuscitation and may provide complementary information. Further research should examine the potential of using rSO  alongside etCO  in CPR algorithms."
"40688246","Effect of prehospital advanced airway management on arterial blood gases in the pragmatic airway resuscitation trial.","Advanced airway devices facilitate ventilation and oxygenation during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Differences in gas exchange between advanced airway devices are unknown. Characterize arterial blood gases (ABG) in laryngeal tube (LT) or endotracheal intubation (ETI) cases in the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial (PART). We included adult OHCAs with ABG collected ≤ 1.5 h after emergency department (ED) arrival. We collected 1) last prehospital airway technique used 2) ABG measurements (pH, PaO , PaCO ), and 3) average prehospital end-tidal capnography (EtCO ) values for the last five minutes. We compared airway types, ABG values, and PaCO -EtCO  absolute difference (PaCO -EtCO ) using the Mann-Whitney test, stratifying by circulation status. We also determined prehospital EtCO  and ED PaCO  correlation. Of 3004 cases, 401 met inclusion with 272 LT and 129 ETI. Among cases achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), pH (7.1 vs. 7.2,   = 0.10) and PaO  (142 vs 170 mmHg,   = 0.08) did not differ. PaCO  was higher in LT than ETI (58 vs 50 mmHg,   = 0.003). Among cases without ROSC, pH (7.0 vs. 7.0,   = 0.55) and PaCO  (64 vs. 61 mmHg,   = 0.58) did not differ, but PaO  was lower in LT than ETI (85 vs. 123 mmHg,   = 0.03). EtCO  did not correlate with PaCO  in any airway device/ROSC combination. PaCO -EtCO  difference was wider in both LT and ETI non-ROSC cases compared to ROSC cases (27 vs 18 mmHg,   = 0.03). ABG values may vary by prehospital advanced airway management methods. The correlation between EtCO  and PaCO  in OHCA patients remains unclear."
"40391858","Ventilation Rates and Capnography in Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest with Advanced Airways.","Ventilation is important in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation; however, few studies describe ventilation rates during pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (pOHCA). Our objective was to characterize ventilations and end-tidal capnography (EtCO ) after advanced airway placement by emergency medical services (EMS) during pOHCA resuscitation. This was a retrospective cohort study that included pediatric (age < 18 years) non-traumatic OHCA treated by an urban fire-based EMS system (Columbus Division of Fire, Columbus, Ohio) from April 2019 to December 2020. We identified ventilations delivered during resuscitation by manual review of continuous EtCO  recorded by cardiac monitors. We also identified ventilations using automated detection algorithms previously validated in adult resuscitation. Mean ventilation rate and EtCO  were summarized in one-minute (min) epochs from advanced airway insertion through end of resuscitation efforts. We compared return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) vs non-ROSC ventilation rates using Student's t-tests. Cochran-Armitage test of trend was used to evaluate EtCO  temporal trends. Associations between ROSC and EtCO  were tested using a regression model. We identified 38 pOHCA cases and 30 cases were included for ventilation analysis. Cases were primarily infants (0.7 years, IQR 0.17-2), male (52.6%), and African-American race (63.1%). Most pOHCAs were unwitnessed (65.8%) with non-shockable rhythms (94.8%) and infrequent bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (31.2%). Eight patients achieved ROSC (21.2%) and two patients survived (5.3%). Advanced airway attempts included supraglottic airway devices (71.1%), endotracheal intubation (7.8%), or both (7.8%). Ventilation rates ranged from 0-23 per minute. Automated ventilation detection algorithms performed well in pediatric ventilation detection where the mean standard error was 3.7 mmHg in EtCO  values and 1.3 per minute in ventilation rates. Ventilation rates differed between ROSC and non-ROSC groups (9.2 vs 6.9 per min,   < 0.001). Ranges of EtCO  values included 0-100 mmHg during resuscitation. The EtCO  trends over time differed between ROSC and non-ROSC groups (59.82 mmHg to 75.9 mmHg vs 20.7 mmHg to 19.0 mmHg,   < 0.01). EtCO  was significantly associated with ROSC (OR 1.0 95% CI 1.00-1.01,   < 0.001). These results offer one of the first perspectives of ventilation in pOHCA. Differences were observed in ventilation rates and EtCO  trends between ROSC and non-ROSC cases."
"40311838","The peak end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration recorded during cardiopulmonary resuscitation as an indicator of survival: a nationwide cohort study of pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.","Although the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (ETCO ) recorded during resuscitation has been reported as an indicator of survival in a few studies of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest, the relationship between ETCO  and survival in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has not previously been investigated (particularly with regard to the cause of the OHCA). This study aimed to determine whether quantitative measurement of ETCO  during resuscitation is predictive of survival in cases of pediatric OHCA. This nationwide, population-based cohort study analyzed data from the French RéAC OHCA registry, including all patients under 18 years of age with trauma-related OHCA or medical OHCA from 2011 to 2023. The highest ETCO  value was recorded during advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The main outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and day (d)30 survival. Discriminant ability was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and the Youden index was used to determine the optimal ETCO  cut-off value. A total of 1209 pediatric OHCAs (226 (19%) trauma-related and 983 (81%) medical) were included. The victims' median [interquartile range] age was 6 [0;14] years. ROSC was achieved in 347 (29%) cases and d30 survival was achieved in 61 (5%) cases. In both trauma-related and medical OHCAs, the peak recorded ETCO  value was higher in patients who achieved ROSC and in d30 survivors. The AUROC [95% confidence interval] for the highest ETCO  that predicted ROSC and d30 survival were respectively 0.808 [0.745-0.872] and 0.854 [0.761-0.947] for the trauma-related OHCA group and 0.803 [0.774-0.831] and 0.732 [0.676-0.787] for the medical OHCA group. In both groups, the probability of ROSC and d30 survival increased with higher ETCO  values, with optimal cut-offs of 21 and 29 mmHg for trauma-related OHCA and 27 and 26 mmHg for medical OHCA, respectively. Further studies are necessary to clarify the use of ETCO  in optimizing pediatric ALS."
"39356210","The Evaluation of Online Medical Consultation Use in Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.","Our study details Online medical consultation (OLMC) usage for Pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (P-OHCA), including proportion of P-OHCA utilizing OLMC, the characteristics of cases using OLMC, the types of information exchanged during OLMC calls, and the outcomes in patients where Emergency Medical Services (EMS) contacted OLMC. The study included P-OHCA patients treated by EMS agencies participating in the regional cardiac registry with total catchment population of approximately 1.5 million residents. We reviewed linked calls and EMS charts for P-OHCA cases treated from January 1st, 2018 through December 31st, 2022. In total, 112 cases from January 2018 to December 2022 were included in the final analysis. Twenty-two out of 112 utilized OLMC with a mean time from 9-1-1 call to OLMC of 28.8 min. The no OLMC group had a significantly higher transport rate than OLMC group as well as higher percentages of ROSC at any time and ROSC upon arrival at the ED. Both survival to admission and survival to discharge were more prevalent in the no OLMC group, while there were no instances of survival to discharge in the OLMC group. During the calls, the discussion of crucial prognostic factors, including witness status, initial rhythm, ETCO2, and arrest duration, appears inconsistent. Pediatric-OHCA cases with OLMC tend to contact OLMC late in the resuscitation, have poor prognostic factors, and have poor survival outcomes. The information exchanged during OLMC calls was highly variable, representing a clear opportunity for improvement. Future studies should explore the potential effect of early OLMC contact on patient outcomes and if a standardized template for OLMC data exchange improves consistency in recommendations for P-OHCA."
"39028238","End-tidal Carbon Dioxide Trajectory-based Prognostication of Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest.","During cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO ) is primarily determined by pulmonary blood flow, thereby reflecting the blood flow generated by CPR. We aimed to develop an EtCO  trajectory-based prediction model for prognostication at specific time points during CPR in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We screened patients receiving CPR between 2015-2021 from a prospectively collected database of a tertiary-care medical center. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify the EtCO  trajectories. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for model development and internally validated using bootstrapping. We assessed performance of the model using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The primary analysis included 542 patients with a median age of 68.0 years. Three distinct EtCO  trajectories were identified in patients resuscitated for 20 minutes (min): low (average EtCO  10.0 millimeters of mercury [mm Hg]; intermediate (average EtCO  26.5 mm Hg); and high (average EtCO : 51.5 mm Hg). Twenty-min EtCO  trajectory was fitted as an ordinal variable (low, intermediate, and high) and positively associated with survival (odds ratio 2.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-4.74). When the 20-min EtCO  trajectory was combined with other variables, including arrest location and arrest rhythms, the AUC of the 20-min prediction model for survival was 0.89 (95% CI 0.86-0.92). All predictors in the 20-min model remained statistically significant after bootstrapping. Time-specific EtCO  trajectory was a significant predictor of OHCA outcomes, which could be combined with other baseline variables for intra-arrest prognostication. For this purpose, the 20-min survival model achieved excellent discriminative performance in predicting survival to hospital discharge."
"39006133","Pre-hospital care after return of spontaneous circulation: Are we achieving our targets?","Early restoration of normal physiology when return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is obtained after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) reduces the risk of developing post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). This study aims to investigate if (and to which extent) this can be achieved within the scope of practice of standard emergency medical services (EMS) crews. A prospective mixed-methods quantitative and qualitative cohort study was performed including adult patients with a non-traumatic OHCA presented to a university hospital emergency department (ED) in the Netherlands after pre-hospital ROSC was obtained. Primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with deranged physiology post-ROSC in whom EMS crews were able to reach recommended treatment targets. During a 32-month period, 160 patients presenting with ROSC after OHCA were included. Median (IQR) pre-hospital treatment duration was 40 (34-51) minutes. When deranged physiology was present (n = 133), it could be restored by EMS crews in 29% of the patients. Although average etCO  and SpO  improved gradually over time during pre-hospital treatment, recommended treatment targets could not be achieved in respectively 55% (30/55) and 43% (20/46) of the patients. Similarly, airway problems (24/46, 52%), hypotension (20/23, 87%) and post-anoxic agitation (16/43, 37%) could often not be resolved by EMS crews. The ability to restore normal physiology by EMS could not be predicted based on patient characteristics or in-arrest variables. Deranged physiology after an OHCA is commonly encountered, and often difficult to treat within the scope of practice of regular EMS crews. Involvement of advanced critical care teams with a wider scope of practice at an early stage may contribute to a better outcome for these patients."
"38967927","Temporal Trends in End-Tidal Capnography and Outcomes in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.","While widely measured, the time-varying association between exhaled end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) outcomes is unclear. To evaluate temporal associations between EtCO2 and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial (PART). This study was a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized trial performed at multicenter emergency medical services agencies from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium. PART enrolled 3004 adults (aged ≥18 years) with nontraumatic OHCA from December 1, 2015, to November 4, 2017. EtCO2 was available in 1172 cases for this analysis performed in June 2023. PART evaluated the effect of laryngeal tube vs endotracheal intubation on 72-hour survival. Emergency medical services agencies collected continuous EtCO2 recordings using standard monitors, and this secondary analysis identified maximal EtCO2 values per ventilation and determined mean EtCO2 in 1-minute epochs using previously validated automated signal processing. All advanced airway cases with greater than 50% interpretable EtCO2 signal were included, and the slope of EtCO2 change over resuscitation was calculated. The primary outcome was ROSC determined by prehospital or emergency department palpable pulses. EtCO2 values were compared at discrete time points using Mann-Whitney test, and temporal trends in EtCO2 were compared using Cochran-Armitage test of trend. Multivariable logistic regression was performed, adjusting for Utstein criteria and EtCO2 slope. Among 1113 patients included in the study, 694 (62.4%) were male; 285 (25.6%) were Black or African American, 592 (53.2%) were White, and 236 (21.2%) were another race; and the median (IQR) age was 64 (52-75) years. Cardiac arrest was most commonly unwitnessed (n = 579 [52.0%]), nonshockable (n = 941 [84.6%]), and nonpublic (n = 999 [89.8%]). There were 198 patients (17.8%) with ROSC and 915 (82.2%) without ROSC. Median EtCO2 values between ROSC and non-ROSC cases were significantly different at 10 minutes (39.8 [IQR, 27.1-56.4] mm Hg vs 26.1 [IQR, 14.9-39.0] mm Hg; P < .001) and 5 minutes (43.0 [IQR, 28.1-55.8] mm Hg vs 25.0 [IQR, 13.3-37.4] mm Hg; P < .001) prior to end of resuscitation. In ROSC cases, median EtCO2 increased from 30.5 (IQR, 22.4-54.2) mm HG to 43.0 (IQR, 28.1-55.8) mm Hg (P for trend < .001). In non-ROSC cases, EtCO2 declined from 30.8 (IQR, 18.2-43.8) mm Hg to 22.5 (IQR, 12.8-35.4) mm Hg (P for trend < .001). Using adjusted multivariable logistic regression with slope of EtCO2, the temporal change in EtCO2 was associated with ROSC (odds ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.31-1.61]). In this secondary analysis of the PART trial, temporal increases in EtCO2 were associated with increased odds of ROSC. These results suggest value in leveraging continuous waveform capnography during OHCA resuscitation. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02419573."

We used resuscitative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to elucidate the impact of uncompressed vs. compressed AV on outcomes of adult patients experiencing OHCA. Prospective observational cohort study. Single center. This study included adult OHCA patients undergoing resuscitative TEE in the emergency department. Patients were categorized into AV uncompressed or AV compressed groups based on TEE findings. None. The primary outcome was sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The secondary outcomes included end-tidal co2 (Et co2 ) during CPR, any ROSC, survival to ICU and hospital discharge, post-resuscitation withdrawal, and favorable neurologic outcomes at discharge. Additional analyses on intra-arrest arterial blood pressure (ABP) were also conducted. The sample size was pre-estimated at 37 patients/group. From October 2020 to January 2023, 76 patients were enrolled, 39 and 37 in the AV uncompressed and AV compressed groups, respectively. Intergroup baseline characteristics were similar. Compared with the AV compressed group, the AV uncompressed group had a higher probability of sustained ROSC (53.8% vs. 24.3%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.72; p = 0.010), any ROSC (56.4% vs. 32.4%; aOR, 3.30; p = 0.033), and survival to ICU (33.3% vs. 8.1%; aOR, 6.74; p = 0.010), and recorded higher initial diastolic ABP (33.4 vs. 11.5 mm Hg; p = 0.002) and a larger proportion achieving diastolic ABP greater than 20 mm Hg during CPR (93.8% vs. 33.3%; p < 0.001). The Et co2 , post-resuscitation withdrawal, and survival to discharge revealed no significant intergroup differences. No patients were discharged with favorable neurologic outcomes. Uncompressed AV seemed critical for sustained ROSC across all subgroups. Absence of AV compression during OHCA resuscitation is associated with an increased chance of ROSC and survival to ICU. However, its effect on long-term outcomes remains unclear."
"38759718","Explorative study on lower inflection point dynamics during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: Potential implications for airway management.","In patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after an Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), intrathoracic airway closure can impede ventilation, adversely affecting patient outcomes. This explorative study investigates the evolution of intrathoracic airway closure by analyzing the lower inflection point (LIP) during the inspiration phase of CPR, aiming to identify the potential thresholds for alveolar recruitment. Eleven OHCA patients undergoing CPR with endotracheal intubation and manual bag ventilation were included. Flow and pressure measurements were obtained using Sensirion SFM3200AW and Wika CPT2500 sensors attached to the endotracheal tube, connected to a Surface Go Tablet for data collection. Flow data was analyzed in Microsoft Excel, while pressure data was processed using the Wika USBsoft2500 application. Analysis focused on the inspiration phase of the first 6-8 breaths, with an additional 2 breaths recorded and analyzed at the end of CPR. Across the cohort, the median tidal volume was 870.00 milliliter (mL), average flow was 31.90 standard liters per minute (slm), and average pressure was 17.21 cmH O. The calculated average LIP was 31.47 cmH O. Most cases (72.7%) exhibited a negative trajectory in LIP evolution during CPR, with 2 cases (18.2%) showing a positive trajectory and 1 case remaining inconclusive. The average LIP in the first 8 breaths was significantly higher than in the last 2 breaths (p = 0.018). No significant correlation was found between average LIP and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), compression depth, frequency, or end-tidal CO  (EtCO ). However, a significant negative correlation was observed between the average LIP of the last 2 breaths and CPR duration (p = 0.023). LIP calculation in low-flow ventilations using the novel mathematical method yielded values consistent with those reported in the literature. These explorative data demonstrate a predominantly negative trajectory in LIP evolution during CPR, suggesting potential challenges in maintaining airway patency. Limitations include a small sample size and sensor recording issues. Further research is warranted to explore the evolution of LIP and its implications for personalized ventilation strategies in CPR."
"38387215","Is the lactate value predictive of the return of spontaneous circulation during CPR in nontraumatic OHCA?","Cardiac arrest is a major public health issue, in which emergency medical services (EMS) initiating or continuing resuscitation in about 50% to 60% of cases. The aim of this study was to determine whether blood lactate levels and their course during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are prognostic indicators of the return of spontaneous cardiac activity (ROSC) in non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This was a prospective, interventional, multi-center study between 2017 and 2020. Patients above the age of 18 years (>50 years for women) who had non-traumatic OHCA and did not achieve ROSC before the arrival of the EMS, and for whom the medical team decided to initiate or continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation have been included. The primary endpoint was the return of spontaneous cardiac activity during out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and secondary endpoint was survival at day 28. The lactate was initially measured simultaneously on a venous and capillary sample and then in capillary samples throughout the CPR, using POC device. A total 60 patients were included. Median age was 71 [IQR: 62-84] and 21.3% were female. Among them, 25% underwent ROSC in out-of-hospital setting, and 13,3% were alive at D-28. The median venous lactate value in all patients at T0 (time at which the EMS set up the peripheral venous line) was 6.2 mmol/L [IQR: 4.6-8.1], with no difference between patients with or without ROSC: 6.4 mmol/L [IQR:4.7-7.9] for patients with ROSC and 6.2 mmol/L [IQR: 4.7-8] for patients without ROSC (p = 0.87). The variables independently associated with ROSC were initial EtCo2 value (aOR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25); the initial shockable rhythm (aOR = 10.2; 95% CI 1.18-88.2); and the pre-ROSC adrenaline dose (aOR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.35-0.82). In this prospective multi-center study, there was no independent association between lactate values during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and ROSC in non-traumatic OHCA. However, the post-ROSC pre-hospital kinetics of lactate (i.e., during the first 30 min) seem to be associated with survival."
"38375443","Association among blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide, peripheral oxygen saturation and mortality in prehospital post-resuscitation care.","Post-resuscitation care is described as the fourth link in a chain of survival in resuscitation guidelines. However, data on prehospital post-resuscitation care is scarce. We aimed to examine the association among systolic blood pressure (SBP), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO ) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO ) after prehospital stabilisation and outcome among patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). In this retrospective study, we evaluated association of the last measured prehospital SBP, SpO  and EtCO  before patient handover with 30-day and one-year mortality in 2,611 patients receiving prehospital post-resuscitation care by helicopter emergency medical services in Finland. Statistical analyses were completed through locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) and multivariable logistic regression. The regression analyses were adjusted by sex, age, initial rhythm, bystander CPR, and time interval from collapse to the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Mortality related to SBP and EtCO  values were U-shaped and lowest at 135 mmHg and 4.7 kPa, respectively, whereas higher SpO2 shifted towards lower mortality. In adjusted analyses, increased 30-day mortality and one year mortality was observed in patients with SBP < 100 mmHg (OR 1.9 [95% CI 1.4-2.4]) and SBP < 100 (OR 1.8 [1.2-2.6]) or EtCO2 < 4.0 kPa (OR 1.4 [1.1-1.5]), respectively. SpO2 was not significantly associated with either 30-day or one year mortality. After prehospital post-resuscitation stabilization, SBP < 100 mmHg and EtCO  < 4.0 kPa were observed to be independently associated with higher mortality. The optimal targets for prehospital post-resuscitation care need to be established in the prospective studies."
"38143529","Percutaneous left ventricular assist devices in refractory cardiac arrest: The role of chest compressions.","Recent studies describe an emerging role for percutaneous left ventricular assist devices such as Impella CP® as rescue therapy for refractory cardiac arrest. We hypothesized that the addition of mechanical chest compressions to percutaneous left ventricular assist device assisted CPR would improve hemodynamics by compressing the right ventricle and augmenting pulmonary blood flow and left ventricular filling. We performed a pilot study to test this hypothesis using a swine model of prolonged cardiac arrest. Eight Yorkshire swine were anesthetized, intubated, and instrumented for hemodynamic monitoring. They were subjected to untreated ventricular fibrillation for 5.75 (SD 2.90) minutes followed by mechanical chest compressions for a mean of 20.0 (SD 5.0) minutes before initiation of percutaneous left ventricular assist device. After percutaneous left ventricular assist device initiation, mechanical chest compressions was stopped (  = 4) or continued (  = 4). Defibrillation was attempted 4, 8 and 12 minutes after initiating percutaneous left ventricular assist device circulatory support. The percutaneous left ventricular assist device + mechanical chest compressions group had significantly higher percutaneous left ventricular assist device flow prior to return of spontaneous heartbeat at four- and twelve-minutes after percutaneous left ventricular assist device initiation, and significantly higher end tidal CO2 at 4-minutes after percutaneous left ventricular assist device initiation, when compared with the percutaneous left ventricular assist device alone group. Carotid artery flow was not significantly different between the two groups. The addition of mechanical chest compressions to percutaneous left ventricular assist device support during cardiac arrest may generate higher percutaneous left ventricular assist device and carotid artery flow prior to return of spontaneous heartbeat compared to percutaneous left ventricular assist device alone. Further studies are needed to determine if this approach improves other hemodynamic parameters or outcomes after prolonged cardiac arrest."

This is a retrospective analysis of adult refractory non-shockable, non-traumatic OHCA patients in the Portland Cardiac Arrest Epidemiologic Registry (PDX Epistry) from 2018 to 2021. We defined refractory non-shockable OHCA cases as patients with lack of a shockable rhythm at any time or return of spontaneous circulation at any time prior to 30-min of on-scene resuscitation. We abstracted ETCO2 values first recorded after advanced airway placement and nearest to the 30-min mark of on-scene resuscitation (30 min-ETCO2) from EMS charts. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We compared 30 min-ETCO2 cutoffs of 10 mmHg and 20 mmHg to the trend (increasing or not) from initial to 30 min-ETCO2 (delta-ETCO2) using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curves (AUROC). Of 3837 adult OHCA, 2850 were initially non-shockable, and there were 617 (16.1%) cases of refractory non-shockable OHCA at 30-min. We excluded 320 cases without at least two ETCO2 recordings in the EMS chart, leaving 297 cases that met inclusion criteria. Of these, 176 (59.3%) were transported and 2 (0.7%) survived to discharge. Using absolute 30 min-ETCO2 cutoffs, both survivors were in the >10 mmHg group (sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 12.5%), whereas only one survivor was identified in the >20 mmHg group (sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 32.5%). Using delta-ETCO2, both survivors were in the increasing ETCO2 group (sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 60.7%). In comparing the two tests that did not misclassify survivors, the AUROC [95% CI] was higher when using delta-ETCO2 (0.803 [0.775-0.831]) compared to an absolute cutoff of 10 mmHg (0.563 [0.544-0.582]). Nearly one-sixth of EMS-treated adult OHCA patients had refractory non-shockable arrests after at least 30 min of ongoing resuscitation. In this group, the ETCO2 trend following advanced airway placement may be more accurate in guiding termination of resuscitation than an absolute ETCO2 cutoff of 10 or 20 mmHg."
"37805062","Association of small adult ventilation bags with return of spontaneous circulation in out of hospital cardiac arrest.","Little is known about the impact of tidal volumes delivered by emergency medical services (EMS) to adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). A large urban EMS system changed from standard adult ventilation bags to small adult bags. We hypothesized that the incidence of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at the end of EMS care would increase after this change. We performed a retrospective analysis evaluating adults treated with advanced airway placement for nontraumatic OHCA between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2021. We compared rates of ROSC, ventilation rate, and mean end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO ) by minute before and after the smaller ventilation bag implementation using linear and logistic regression. Of the 1,994 patients included, 1,331 (67%) were treated with a small adult bag. ROSC at the end of EMS care was lower in the small bag cohort than the large bag cohort, 33% vs 40% (p = 0.003). After adjustment, small bag use was associated with lower odds of ROSC at the end of EMS care [OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 - 0.91]. Ventilation rates did not differ between cohorts. ETCO  values were lower in the large bag cohort (33.2 ± 17.2 mmHg vs. 36.9 ± 19.2 mmHg, p < 0.01). Use of a small adult bag during OHCA was associated with lower odds of ROSC at the end of EMS care. The effects on acid base status, hemodynamics, and delivered minute ventilation remain unclear and warrant additional study."
"37751228","The Association of Prehospital End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide with Survival Following Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.","End tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO ) is often used to assess ventilation and perfusion during cardiac arrest resuscitation. However, few data exist evaluating the relationship between ETCO  values and mortality in the context of contemporary resuscitation practices. We aimed to explore the association between ETCO  and mortality following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We used the 2018-2021 ESO annual datasets to query all non-traumatic OHCA patients with attempted resuscitation. Patients with documented DNR/POLST, EMS-witnessed arrest, ROSC after bystander CPR only, or < 2 documented ETCO  values were excluded. The lowest and highest ETCO  values recorded during the total prehospital interval, in addition to the pre- and post-ROSC intervals for resuscitated patients, were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, initial rhythm, witnessed status, bystander CPR, etiology, OHCA location, sodium bicarbonate administration, number of milligrams of epinephrine administered, and response interval were used to evaluate the association between measures of ETCO  and mortality. Hospital outcome data were available for 14,122 patients, and 2,209 (15.6%) were classified as surviving to discharge. Compared to patients with maximum prehospital ETCO  values of 30-40 mmHg, odds of mortality were increased for patients with maximum prehospital ETCO  values of <20 mmHg (aOR: 3.5 [2.1, 5,9]), 20-29 mmHg (aOR: 1.5 [1.1, 2.1]), and >50 mmHg (aOR: 1.5 [1.2, 1.8]). After 20 minutes of ETCO  monitoring, <12% of patients had ETCO  values <10 mmHg. This cutpoint was 96.7% specific and 6.9% sensitive for mortality. In this dataset, both high and low ETCO  values were associated with increased mortality. Contemporary resuscitation practices may make low ETCO  values uncommon, and field termination decision algorithms should not use ETCO  values in isolation."
"37278780","End-tidal Carbon Dioxide + Return of Spontaneous Circulation After Cardiac Arrest (RACA) Score to Predict Outcomes After Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest.","The return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest (RACA) score is a well-validated model for estimating the probability of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) by incorporating several variables, including gender, age, arrest aetiology, witness status, arrest location, initial cardiac rhythms, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and emergency medical services (EMS) arrival time. The RACA score was initially designed for comparisons between different EMS systems by standardising ROSC rates. End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO ) is a quality indicator of CPR. We aimed to improve the performance of the RACA score by adding minimum EtCO  measured during CPR to develop the EtCO  + RACA score for OHCA patients transported to an emergency department (ED). This was a retrospective analysis using prospectively collected data for OHCA patients resuscitated at an ED during 2015-2020. Adult patients with advanced airways inserted and available EtCO  measurements were included. We used the EtCO  values recorded in the ED for analysis. The primary outcome was ROSC. In the derivation cohort, we used multivariable logistic regression to develop the model. In the temporally split validation cohort, we assessed the discriminative performance of the EtCO  + RACA score by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared it with the RACA score using the DeLong test. There were 530 and 228 patients in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The median measurements of EtCO  were 8.0 times (interquartile range [IQR] 3.0-12.0 times), with the median minimum EtCO  of 15.5 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) (IQR 8.0-26.0 mm Hg). The median RACA score was 36.4% (IQR 28.9-48.0%), and a total of 393 patients (51.8%) achieved ROSC. The EtCO  + RACA score was validated with good discriminative performance (AUC, 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.88), outperforming the RACA score (AUC, 0.71, 95% CI 0.65-0.78) (DeLong test: P < 0.001). The EtCO  + RACA score may facilitate the decision-making process regarding allocations of medical resources in EDs for OHCA resuscitation."
"36461052","Prehospital monitoring of cerebral circulation during out of hospital cardiac arrest ? A feasibility study.","About two-thirds of the in-hospital deaths after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) are a consequence of anoxic brain injuries, which are due to hypoperfusion of the brain during the cardiac arrests. Being able to monitor cerebral perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is desirable to evaluate the effectiveness of the CPR and to guide further decision making and prognostication. Two different devices were used to measure regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2): INVOS™ 5100 (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Root® O3 (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA). At the scene of the OHCA, advanced life support (ALS) was immediately initiated by the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel. Sensors for measuring rSO2 were applied at the scene or during transportation to the hospital. rSO2 values were documented manually together with ETCO2 (end tidal carbon dioxide) on a worksheet specially designed for this study. The study worksheet also included a questionnaire for the EMS personnel with one statement on usability regarding potential interference with ALS. Twenty-seven patients were included in the statistical analyses. In the INVOS™5100 group (n = 13), the mean rSO2 was 54% (95% CI 40.3-67.7) for patients achieving a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 28% (95% CI 12.3-43.7) for patients not achieving ROSC (p = 0.04). In the Root® O3 group (n = 14), the mean rSO2 was 50% (95% CI 46.5-53.5) and 41% (95% CI 36.3-45.7) (p = 0.02) for ROSC and no ROSC, respectively. ETCO2 values were not statistically different between the groups. The EMS personnel graded the statement of interference with ALS to a median of 2 (IQR 1-6) on a 10-point Numerical Rating Scale. Our results suggest that both INVOS™5100 and ROOT® O3 can distinguish between ROSC and no ROSC in OHCA, and both could be used in the pre-hospital setting and during transport with minimal interference with ALS."
"36252855","Increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide after defibrillation predicts sustained return of spontaneous circulation during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.","Guidelines recommend monitoring end-tidal carbon dioxide (E CO ) during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), though its prognostic value is poorly understood. This study investigated the relationship between E CO  and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after defibrillation in intubated non-traumatic OHCA patients. This retrospective, observational cohort analysis included adult OHCA patients who received a defibrillation shock during treatment by an urban EMS agency from 2015 to 2021. Peak E CO  values were determined for the 90-second periods before and after the first defibrillation in an intubated patient (shock of interest [SOI]). Values were analyzed for association between the change in E CO  from pre- to post-shock and the presence of ROSC on the subsequent pulse check. Of 518 eligible patients, mean age was 61, 72% were male, 50% had a bystander-witnessed arrest, and 62% had at least one episode of ROSC. The most common arrest etiology was medical (92%). Among all patients, peak E CO  during resuscitation prior to SOI was 36.8 mmHg (18.6). E CO  increased in patients who achieved ROSC immediately after SOI (from 38.3 to 47.6 mmHg; +9.3 CI: 6.5, 12.1); patients with sustained ROSC experienced the greatest increase in E CO  after SOI (from 37.8 to 48.2 mmHg; +10.4 CI: 7.2, 13.6), while E CO  in patients who did not achieve ROSC after SOI rose (from 36.4 to 37.8 mmHg; +1.4 CI: -0.1, 2.8). E CO  rises after defibrillation in most patients during cardiac arrest. Patients with sustained ROSC experience larger rises, though the majority experience rises of less than 10 mmHg."
"36183813","The association between arterial-end-tidal carbon dioxide difference and outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.","We sought to determine if the difference between P CO  and E CO  is associated with hospital mortality and neurologic outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after OHCA over 3 years. The primary exposure was the P CO -E CO  difference on hospital arrival. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. The secondary outcome was favorable neurologic status at discharge. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine discrimination threshold and multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between the P CO -E CO  difference and outcome. Of 698 OHCA patients transported to the hospitals, 381 had sustained ROSC and qualifying E CO  and P CO  values. Of these, 160 (42%) survived to hospital discharge. Mean E CO  was 39 mmHg among survivors and 43 mmHg among non-survivors. Mean P CO -E CO  was 6.8 mmHg and 9.0 mmHg (p < 0.05) for survivors and non-survivors. After adjustment for Utstein characteristics, a higher P CO -E CO  difference on hospital arrival was not associated with hospital mortality (OR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.0) or neurological outcome. Area under the ROC curve or P CO -E CO  difference was 0.56 (95% CI 0.51-0.62) compared with 0.58 (95% CI 0.52-0.64) for E CO . Neither P CO -E CO  nor E CO  were strong predictors of survival or neurologic status at hospital discharge. While they may be useful to guide ventilation and resuscitation, these measures should not be used for prognostication after OHCA."
"36162612","End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) at intubation and its increase after 10 minutes resuscitation predicts survival with good neurological outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients.","To evaluate whether end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) value at intubation and its early increase (10 min) after intubation predict both the survival to hospital admission and the survival at hospital discharge, including good neurological outcome (CPC 1-2), in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). All consecutive OHCA patients of any etiology between 2015 and 2018 in Pavia Province (Italy) and Ticino Region (Switzerland) were considered. Patients died before ambulance arrival, with a ""do-not-resuscitate"" order, without ETCO2 value or with incomplete data were excluded. The study population consisted of 668 patients. An ETCO2 value at intubation > 20 mmHg and its increase 10 min after intubation were independent predictors (after correction for known predictors of OHCA outcome) of survival to hospital admission and survival at hospital discharge. Relative to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome, ETCO2 at intubation and its 10-min change were confirmed predictors both individually and in a bivariable analysis (OR 1.83, 95 %CI 1.02-3.3; p = 0.04 and OR 3.9, 95 %CI 1.97-7.74; p < 0.001, respectively). This was confirmed also when accounting for gender, age, etiology and location. After further adjustment for bystander and CPR status, presenting rhythm and EMS arrival time, the ETCO2 change remained an independent predictor. ETCO2 value > 20 mmHg at intubation and its increase during resuscitation improve the prediction of survival at hospital discharge with good neurological outcome of OHCA patients. ETCO2 increase during resuscitation is a more powerful predictor than ETCO2 at intubation. A larger prospective study to confirm this finding appears warranted."
"35909151","Implementation of a Pediatric Emergency Department Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Quality Bundle.","We have previously demonstrated that standardized handoff from prehospital to hospital clinicians can improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients in a pediatric emergency department (ED). We leveraged our previous quality improvement initiative to standardize performance of a bundle of 5 discrete aspects of resuscitation for OHCA patients: intravenous or intraosseous catheter (IV/IO) access, epinephrine administration, advanced airway placement, end-tidal capnography (ETCO2) application, and cardiac rhythm verbalization. We aimed to reduce time to completion of the bundle from 302 seconds at baseline to less than 120 seconds within 1 year. A multidisciplinary team performed video-based review of actual OHCA resuscitations in our pediatric ED. We designed interventions aimed at key drivers of bundle performance. Interventions included specific roles and responsibilities and a standardized choreography for each bundle element. To assess the effect of the interventions, time to performance of each bundle element was measured by standardized review of video recordings from our resuscitation bay. Balancing measures were time off the chest and time to defibrillator pad placement. We analyzed 56 cases of OHCA from May 2019 through May 2021. Time to bundle completion improved from a baseline of 302 seconds to 147 seconds. Four of 5 individual bundle elements also demonstrated significant improvement. These improvements were sustained without any negative impact on balancing measures. Standardized choreography for the initial minutes of ED cardiac arrest resuscitation shows promise to decrease time to crucial interventions in children presenting to the pediatric ED with OHCA."
"35850376","Investigating the Airway Opening Index during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","Chest compressions during CPR induce oscillations in capnography (E CO ) waveforms. Studies suggest E CO  oscillation characteristics are associated with intrathoracic airflow dependent on airway patency. Oscillations can be quantified by the Airway Opening Index (AOI). We sought to evaluate multiple methods of computing AOI and their association with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). We conducted a retrospective study of 307 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) cases in Seattle, WA during 2019. E CO  and chest impedance waveforms were annotated for the presence of intubation and CPR. We developed four methods for computing AOI based on peak E CO  and the oscillations in E CO  during chest compressions (ΔE CO ). We examined the feasibility of automating ΔE CO  and AOI calculation and evaluated differences in AOI across the methods using nonparametric testing (α = 0.05). Median [interquartile range] AOI across all cases using Methods 1-4 was 28.0 % [17.9-45.5 %], 20.6 % [13.0-36.6 %], 18.3 % [11.4-30.4 %], and 22.4 % [12.8-38.5 %], respectively (p < 0.001). Cases with ROSC had a higher median AOI than those without ROSC across all methods, though not statistically significant. Cases with ROSC had a significantly higher median [interquartile range] ΔE CO  of 7.3 mmHg [4.5-13.6 mmHg] compared to those without ROSC (4.8 mmHg [2.6-9.1 mmHg], p < 0.001). We calculated AOI using four proposed methods resulting in significantly different AOI. Additionally, AOI and ΔE CO  were larger in cases achieving ROSC. Further investigation is required to characterize AOI's ability to predict OHCA outcomes, and whether this information can improve resuscitation care."
"35835250","Contribution of chest compressions to end-tidal carbon dioxide levels generated during out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","Characterise how changes in chest compression depth and rate affect variations in end-tidal CO  (ETCO ) during manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Retrospective analysis of adult OHCA monitor-defibrillator recordings having concurrent capnogram, compression depth, transthoracic impedance and ECG, and with atleast 1,000 compressions. Within each patient, during no spontaneous circulation, nearby segments with changes in chest compression depth and rate were identified. Average ETCO  within each segment was standardised to compensate for ventilation rate variability. Contributions of relative variations in depth and rate to relative variations in standardised ETCO  were characterised using linear and non-linear models. Normalisation between paired segments removed intra and inter-patient variation and made coefficients of the model independent of the scale of measurement and therefore directly comparable. A total of 394 pairs of segments from 221 patients were analysed (33% female, median (IQR) age 66 (55-74) years). Chest compression depth and rate were 50.4 (43.2-57.0)mm and 111.1 (106.5-116.1)compressions per minute. ETCO  before and after standardization was 32.1 (23.0-41.4)mmHg and 28.5 (19.4-38.7)mmHg. Linear model coefficient of determination was 0.89. Variation in compression depth mainly explained ETCO  variation (coefficient 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.98) while changes in compression rate did not (coefficient 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.07). Non-linear trend analysis confirmed the results. This study quantified the relative importance of chest compression characteristics in terms of their impact on CO  production during CPR. With ventilation rate standardised, variation in chest compression depth explained variations in ETCO  better than variation in chest compression rate."
"35750286","Association between trajectories of end-tidal carbon dioxide and return of spontaneous circulation among emergency department patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.","We aimed to identify distinct trajectories of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO ) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and to investigate the association between EtCO  trajectories and OHCA outcomes. This was a secondary analysis of a prospectively collected database on adult patients with OHCA who had been resuscitated in the emergency department of a tertiary medical center between 2015 and 2020. The primary outcome was the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify the EtCO  trajectories. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between EtCO  trajectories and ROSC. The predictive performance of the EtCO  trajectories was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The study comprised 655 patients with OHCA. In the primary analysis, three distinct EtCO  trajectories, including 10-mmHg, 30-mmHg, and 50-mmHg trajectories, were identified. Compared with the 10-mmHg trajectory, both 30-mmHg (odds ratio [OR]: 4.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.15-6.90) and 50-mmHg (OR: 7.58, 95% CI: 4.30-13.35) trajectories were associated with a higher likelihood of ROSC. In a sensitivity analysis of excluding EtCO  measured before tracheal intubation or after sodium bicarbonate administration, the predictive ability of the identified EtCO  trajectories remained. As a single predictor of ROSC, EtCO  trajectories had an acceptable discriminative performance (AUC: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.66-0.73). Three distinct EtCO  trajectories during cardiopulmonary resuscitation were identified and significantly associated with outcomes. Early identification of these EtCO  trajectories could potentially guide the ongoing resuscitation efforts."

"35124336","Chest compression release velocity: An independent determinant of end-tidal carbon dioxide in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.","Chest compression (CC) depth, CC rate and ventilatory rate (VR) are known to have an impact on end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO ) values. Chest compression release velocity (CCRV) is increasingly acknowledged as a novel metric in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The objective of this study was to analyze whether CCRV would have any effect on ETCO  values. In out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA), effects of CC depth, CC rate, CCRV and VR on ETCO  were analyzed through linear mixed effect models. A stratification was made on a CCRV of 300, 400 and 500 mm/s. In these categories, mean ETCO  values were corrected for CC depth and compared through a one-way ANOVA. A 10 mm increase in CC depth was associated with a 1.5 mmHg increase in ETCO  (p < 0.001), a 100 mm/s increase in CCRV with a 0.8 mmHg increase (p = 0.010) and a 5 breaths per minute increase in VR with a 2.0 mmHg decrease (p < 0.001). CC depth was strongly correlated with CCRV (Pearson's r = 0.709, p < 0.001). After adjusting for CC depth, ETCO  was on average 6.5 mmHg higher at a CCRV of 500 than at 400 mm/s (p = 0.005) and 5.3 mmHg higher than at 300 mm/s (p = 0.033). In OHCA patients, higher CCRV values resulted in higher ETCO  values. This effect is independent of CC depth, despite the strong correlation between CCRV and CC depth."

However, this has not been consistently reflected in the physiologically unstable pre-hospital patient. This study aims to elucidate the PaCO -ETCO  gradient for pre-hospital intubated patients. This was a retrospective, cohort study using data identified from the HEMSbase 2 database (Feb 2015-Nov 2018). Patients were included if they had documented ETCO  and arterial PaCO  measurements. Arterial PaCO  data that could not be linked to within 5 minutes of ETCO  were excluded. Bland-Altman plots were calculated to describe agreement. A total of 73 patients were identified. Aetiology was arranged into three categories: 13 (17.8%) medical, 22 (30.1%) traumatic and 38 (52.1%) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The median PaCO -ETCO  gradient was 2.0 [1.3-3.1] kPa. A PaCO -ETCO  gradient of 0-1 kPa was seen for only 11 (15.1%) of total patients. The Bland-Altman agreement for all aetiologies was more than the accepted gradient of 0-1 kPa with the largest bias and widest limits of agreement seen for OHCA (-3.2 [0.3 - -6.8]). The magnitude of the differences between the ETCO  and PaCO , levels of variation and inability to predict this suggest that ETCO  is not a suitable surrogate upon which to base ventilatory settings in conditions where pH or PaCO  require precise control."

The ultrasound (US) images were reviewed by a single POCUS expert investigator to determine the adequacy of the POCUS video acquisition and accuracy of the video interpretation. Change in patient management and resuscitation protocol adherence data, including end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) monitoring following advanced airway placement, adrenaline administration, and compression pauses under ten seconds, were queried from the prehospital electronic health record (EHR). Captured images were deemed adequate in 42/49 (85.7%) scans and paramedic interpretation of sonography was accurate in 43/49 (87.7%) scans. The POCUS results altered patient management in 14/49 (28.6%) cases. Paramedics adhered to EtCO2 monitoring in 36/36 (100.0%) patients with an advanced airway, adrenaline administration for 38/38 (100.0%) patients, and compression pauses under ten seconds for 36/38 (94.7%) patients. Paramedics were able to accurately obtain and interpret cardiac POCUS videos during medical OHCA while adhering to a resuscitation protocol. These findings suggest that POCUS can be effectively integrated into paramedic protocols for medical OHCA."

This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study performed in three emergency departments (EDs) of three regional hospitals from 1/1/2012 to 31/12/2018. Patients of OHCA aged ≥18 years old were included. Those with post-mortem changes, return of spontaneous circulation and receiving no resuscitation in EDs were excluded. A TOR rule was derived by logistic regression analysis based on demographics and end-tidal carbon dioxide level of included subjects with pre-hospital defibrillation given. There were 447 included patients had received pre-hospital defibrillation, in which 148 had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), with 22 survived to discharge (STD). Independent predictors for death on or before ED arrival (no ROSC) included EMS call to ED time >20 min and ETCO2 level <20 mmHg from first three sets. A 2-criteria rule predicting death on or before ED arrival by fulfilling both of the independent predictors had a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI 0.90-0.98) and positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.95 (95% CI 0.90-0.98), if 2nd set of ETCO2 was used. The positive likelihood ratio was 10.04 (95% CI 4.83-20.89). The 2-criteria TOR rule for OHCA patients with pre-hospital defibrillation had a high specificity and PPV for predicting death on or before ED arrival."
"34624410","Pulse oximetry waveform: A non-invasive physiological predictor for the return of spontaneous circulation in cardiac arrest patients ---- A multicenter, prospective observational study.","This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of pulse oximetry plethysmography (POP) for the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in cardiac arrest (CA) patients. This was a multicenter, observational, prospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with cardiac arrest at 14 teaching hospitals cross China from December 2013 through November 2014. The study endpoint was ROSC, defined as the restoration of a palpable pulse and an autonomous cardiac rhythm lasting for at least 20 minutes after the completion or cessation of CPR. 150 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients and 291 in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) patients were enrolled prospectively. ROSC was achieved in 20 (13.3%) and 64 (22.0%) patients in these cohorts, respectively. In patients with complete end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO ) and POP data, patients with ROSC had significantly higher levels of POP area under the curve (AUCp), wave amplitude (Amp) and ETCO  level during CPR than those without ROSC (all p < 0.05). Pairwise comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated no significant difference was observed between ETCO  and Amp (p = 0.204) or AUCp (p = 0.588) during the first two minutes of resuscitation. POP may be a novel and effective method for predicting ROSC during resuscitation, with a prognostic value similar to ETCO  at early stage."
"34416306","The association between end-tidal CO2 and return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity.","End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) has been suggested to have prognostic implications during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Our objective was to determine if the change in ETCO2 (delta ETCO2) during resuscitation was predictive of future return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests. We performed a retrospective, observational study of adult (≥18 years of age) non-traumatic PEA OHCAs in two Canadian EMS systems over a two-year time frame beginning on January 1, 2018. Cases were excluded if there was a Do Not Resuscitate order (DNR), had no advanced airway, or had less than two ETCO2 recordings. We performed multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between ETCO2 measures and ROSC. Second, we examined the prognostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV) for ETCO2 at specific thresholds for predicting ROSC. A total of 208 OHCA met inclusion criteria of which 67 (32%) obtained ROSC. After adjusting for pre-determined confounders, there was an association between delta ETCO2 and ROSC (odds ratio [OR] per 10 mmHg increase in ETCO2 of 1.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35 to 2.24); P value < 0.001). We also found significant associations between both initial ETCO2 and final ETCO2 with ROSC. Our analysis indicates that there is a positive linear relationship between delta ETCO2 and ROSC with values of delta ETCO2 > 20 mmHg being highly specific for ROSC in PEA patients. As such, patients with up-trending ETCO2 values should have resuscitation continued unless there is overwhelming clinical evidence to the contrary."

This scoping review was undertaken as part of the continuous evidence evaluation process of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) and based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched from the last ILCOR reviews until September 2020. We included all published studies evaluating the effect of echocardiography, EtCO , BP or NIRS guided CPR on clinical outcomes and quality of CPR. We identified eight observational studies, including 288 children. Two case series reported the use of echocardiography, one in detecting pulmonary emboli, the second in cardiac standstill, where contractility was regained with the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The two studies describing EtCO  were ambivalent regarding the association between mean values and any outcomes. Mean diastolic BP was associated with increased survival and favourable neurological outcome, but not with new substantive morbidity in two studies describing an overlapping population. NIRS values reflected changes in EtCO  and cerebral blood volume index in two studies, with lower values in patients who did not achieve return of circulation. Although there seems some beneficial effect of these intra-arrest variables, higher quality paediatric studies are needed to evaluate whether echocardiography, EtCO , BP or NIRS guided CPR could improve outcomes."
"34089774","Resuscitative endovascular occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) for refractory out of hospital cardiac arrest. An Utstein-based case series.","Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is still a leading cause of mortality worldwide. In recent years, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) has been progressively studied as an adjunct to standard advanced life support (ALS) in both traumatic and non-traumatic refractory OHCA. Since January 2019, the REBOA procedure has been applied to all the patients experiencing both traumatic and non-traumatic refractory OHCA (≥15 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation) not eligible for ECPR for clinical or logistic reasons. We aimed at describing the feasibility and effects of REBOA performed both in the Emergency Department and in the pre-hospital environment served by the local HEMS for refractory OHCA. Twenty consecutive patients experiencing refractory OHCA and in whom REBOA was attempted in 2019 and 2020 were included in the study, Utstein data and REBOA specific variables were recorded. Successful catheter placement was achieved in 18 out of 20 patients, 11 of these were non-traumatic OHCAs while 7 were traumatic OHCAs, the 2 failures were related to repeated arterial puncture failure. Median time between the EMS dispatch and REBOA catheter placing attempt was 46 min. An increase in etCO  over 10 mmHg was observed after balloon inflation in 12 out of 18 patients (8/11 non-traumatic and 4/7 traumatic OHCAs), a sustained ROSC was observed in 5 patients (1 traumatic and 4 non-traumatic OHCA) that were subsequently admitted to the ICU. Four out of the 5 patients reached the criteria for brain death in the subsequent 24 h while one patient experienced another episode of refractory cardiac arrest in ICU and subsequently died. Our data confirm the feasibility of REBOA technique as an adjunct to ALS in both the ED and prehospital phase and most of the treated patients experienced a transient ROSC after balloon inflation while 5 out of 18 experienced a sustained ROSC. However, while in the trauma setting increasing evidence suggests an improved survival when REBOA is applied to refractory OHCA, in non-traumatic OHCA this has yet to be demonstrated and large studies are needed."
"34003839","Assessment of the evolution of end-tidal carbon dioxide within chest compression pauses to detect restoration of spontaneous circulation.","Measurement of end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) can help to monitor circulation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, early detection of restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during CPR using waveform capnography remains a challenge. The aim of the study was to investigate if the assessment of ETCO2 variation during chest compression pauses could allow for ROSC detection. We hypothesized that a decay in ETCO2 during a compression pause indicates no ROSC while a constant or increasing ETCO2 indicates ROSC. We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) episodes treated by the advanced life support (ALS). Continuous chest compressions and ventilations were provided manually. Segments of capnography signal during pauses in chest compressions were selected, including at least three ventilations and with durations less than 20 s. Segments were classified as ROSC or non-ROSC according to case chart annotation and examination of the ECG and transthoracic impedance signals. The percentage variation of ETCO2 between consecutive ventilations was computed and its average value, ΔETavg, was used as a single feature to discriminate between ROSC and non-ROSC segments. A total of 384 segments (130 ROSC, 254 non-ROSC) from 205 OHCA patients (30.7% female, median age 66) were analyzed. Median (IQR) duration was 16.3 (12.9,18.1) s. ΔETavg was 0.0 (-0.7, 0.9)% for ROSC segments and -11.0 (-14.1, -8.0)% for non-ROSC segments (p < 0.0001). Best performance for ROSC detection yielded a sensitivity of 95.4% (95% CI: 90.1%, 98.1%) and a specificity of 94.9% (91.4%, 97.1%) for all ventilations in the segment. For the first 2 ventilations, duration was 7.7 (6.0, 10.2) s, and sensitivity and specificity were 90.0% (83.5%, 94.2%) and 89.4 (84.9%, 92.6%), respectively. Our method allowed for ROSC detection during the first compression pause in 95.4% of the patients. Average percent variation of ETCO2 during pauses in chest compressions allowed for ROSC discrimination. This metric could help confirm ROSC during compression pauses in ALS settings."
"32986490","Predictive Utility of End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide on Defibrillation Success in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.","The likelihood of survival from ventricular fibrillation (VF) declines 7%-10% per minute until successful defibrillation. When VF duration is prolonged, immediate defibrillation of the ischemic myocardium is less likely to result in ROSC, and repeated unsuccessful defibrillations are associated with post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction. Thus, the timing of defibrillation should be based upon the probability of shock success-a function of VF duration. Unfortunately, VF duration is often unknown in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and a better predictor of shock success is needed. To assess the ability of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO ) to predict successful defibrillation in OHCA. This retrospective study included adult patients among four EMS systems who experienced non-traumatic OHCA from August, 2015-July, 2017 and received one or more defibrillations. First and succedent shocks were analyzed separately. First shocks represented EMS-attempted defibrillation of patients who had not received a prior AED shock, whereas succedent shocks included all shocks subsequent to the first. Logistic regression provided odds ratios (OR) for first shocks resulting in ROSC, while a generalized estimating equation was used to analyze succedent shocks. Among 324 patients, 869 shocks were delivered by EMS (153 first and 716 succedent shocks). Layperson CPR was performed in 48.1% of cases and 21.6% received an AED shock before EMS arrival. First defibrillation ROSC was more likely with layperson CPR (OR = 4.41;p = 0.01) and increasing EtCO  (OR = 1.03/mmHg;p = 0.01). No other variables were statistically significant. Notably, only one patient with EtCO  < 20 mmHg was successfully defibrillated on the first shock. The probability of ROSC was higher with increasing values of EtCO  when layperson CPR was provided, yet remained relatively unchanged across all values of EtCO  ≥ 20 mmHg without layperson CPR. The optimal threshold first shock EtCO  was 27 and 32 mmHg for those with/without layperson CPR, respectively. EtCO  was not a predictor of ROSC for succedent shocks. An optimal defibrillation threshold EtCO2 of 27 and 32 mmHg was observed for patients with and without layperson CPR, respectively. Further studies are warranted to verify these results and to evaluate the clinical effect of delaying defibrillation in favor of chest compressions until these values are attained."
"32912645","Ultrasound-Guided Chest Compressions in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests.","There is a significant variability in survival rates for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in out of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), and some data indicate that ultrasound improves CPR. We evaluated the feasibility of ultrasound for monitoring chest compressions in OHCA. We planned a prospective study in patients with an ultrasound-integrated CPR for OHCA. Chest compressions were performed on the intermammillary line (IML), but the position was changed according to the quality of the heart squeezing, evaluated by ultrasound. End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO ) was used as the control parameter. Then we compared the area with the highest squeezing with the position of the heart in the chest computed tomography (CT) scans of 20 hospitalized patients. Chest compressions were good, partial, and inadequate on the IML in 58.4%, 48.9%, and 2.8% of cases, respectively. These percentages were 75%, 25%, and 0% after these modifications: none (47.2%), increased depth (8.3%), hands moved on the lower third of the sternum (27.8%), on left parasternal line of the lower part of the sternum (13.9%), and on the center of the sternum (1 case). Accordingly, ETCO  improved significantly (20.37 vs. 37.10, p < 0.0001). The CT scans showed that the larger biventricular area (BVA) was under the parasternal line of the lower third of the sternum, and the mean distance IML-BVA was 5.7 cm. Our study has demonstrated that CPR in OHCA can be improved using ultrasound and changing the position of the hands. This finding was connected with the ETCO  and confirmed by chest CT scans."
"32622015","The impact of ventilation rate on end-tidal carbon dioxide level during manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","Ventilation rate is a confounding factor for interpretation of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO ) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The aim of our study was to model the effect of ventilation rate on ETCO  during manual CPR in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We conducted a retrospective analysis of OHCA monitor-defibrillator files with concurrent capnogram, compression depth, transthoracic impedance and ECG. We annotated pairs of capnogram segments presenting differences in average ventilation rate and average ETCO  value but with other influencing factors (e.g. compression rate and depth) presenting similar values within the pair. ETCO  variation as a function of ventilation rate was adjusted through curve fitting using non-linear least squares as a measure of goodness of fit. A total of 141 pairs of segments from 102 patients were annotated. Each pair provided a single data point for curve fitting. The best goodness of fit yielded a coefficient of determination R  of 0.93. Our model described that ETCO  decays exponentially with increasing ventilation rate. The model showed no differences attributable to the airway type (endotracheal tube or supraglottic King-LT-D). Capnogram interpretation during CPR is challenging since many factors influence ETCO . For adequate interpretation, we need to know the effect of each factor on ETCO . Our model allows quantifying the effect of ventilation rate on ETCO  variation. Our findings could contribute to better interpretation of ETCO  during CPR."
"32308184","Prehospital Disposition and Patient Outcomes in Cardiac Arrest AFTER Resuscitation Termination Protocol Change in an Urban Setting.","Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death in the United States, and efforts have been made to develop termination of resuscitation protocols utilizing clinical criteria predictive of successful resuscitation and survival to discharge. A termination of resuscitation protocol utilizing longer resuscitation time and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) monitoring criteria for termination was implemented for Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers in an urban prehospital system in 2017. This study examines the effect the modified termination of resuscitation protocol had on rates of patient transport to a hospital, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and survival to discharge. A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) database. A total of 1,005 prehospital cardiac arrest patients 18 years and older from 2016 through 2017 were included in the analysis. Patients with traumatic cardiac arrest or had valid do-not-resuscitate orders were excluded. Unadjusted analysis using chi-square statistics was performed, including an analysis stratified by Utstein style reporting. Adjusted analysis was also performed using logistic regression with multiple imputation for missing values. Unadjusted analysis showed a significant decrease in ROSC on emergency department (ED) arrival (30% versus 13%; P <.001) following the change in protocol. There was no significant difference in patient transport rate (62%) and a statistically non-significant decrease in overall survival (15% versus 11%). When stratified by Utstein style analysis, statistically significant decreases in ED arrival with ROSC were seen for unwitnessed asystolic, as well as bystander witnessed asystolic, pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and shockable OHCA. Adjusted analysis showed a decreased likelihood of ROSC with the protocol change (0.337; 95% CI, 0.235-0.482). The modification of termination of resuscitation protocol was not associated with a statistically significant change in transport rate or survival. A significant decrease in rate of arrivals to the ED with ROSC was seen, particularly for bystander witnessed OHCA."
"32023298","Modeling the impact of ventilations on the capnogram in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.","Current resuscitation guidelines recommend waveform capnography as an indirect indicator of perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Chest compressions (CCs) and ventilations during CPR have opposing effects on the exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, which need to be better characterized. The purpose of this study was to model the impact of ventilations in the exhaled CO2 measured from capnograms collected during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resuscitation. We retrospectively analyzed OHCA monitor-defibrillator files with concurrent capnogram, compression depth, transthoracic impedance and ECG signals. Segments with CC pauses, two or more ventilations, and with no pulse-generating rhythm were selected. Thus, only ventilations should have caused the decrease in CO2 concentration. The variation in the exhaled CO2 concentration with each ventilation was modeled with an exponential decay function using non-linear-least-squares curve fitting. Out of the original 1002 OHCA dataset (one per patient), 377 episodes had the required signals, and 196 segments from 96 patients met the inclusion criteria. Airway type was endotracheal tube in 64.8% of the segments, supraglottic King LT-D™ in 30.1%, and unknown in 5.1%. Median (IQR) decay factor of the exhaled CO2 concentration was 10.0% (7.8 - 12.9) with R2 = 0.98(0.95 - 0.99). Differences in decay factor with airway type were not statistically significant (p = 0.17). From these results, we propose a model for estimating the contribution of CCs to the end-tidal CO2 level between consecutive ventilations and for estimating the end-tidal CO2 variation as a function of ventilation rate. We have modeled the decrease in exhaled CO2 concentration with ventilations during chest compression pauses in CPR. This finding allowed us to hypothesize a mathematical model for explaining the effect of chest compressions on ETCO2 compensating for the influence of ventilation rate during CPR. However, further work is required to confirm the validity of this model during ongoing chest compressions."

In 2010, the American Heart Association began endorsing TF-HP-CPR (). A rural-area Virginia emergency medical services (EMS) system receives assistant medical oversight from an emergency nurse practitioner (ENP). The ENP is responsible for assisting the physician medical director in promoting continuous quality improvement (QI) within the EMS system. In January 2018, a QI project implemented a TF-HP-CPR protocol. The QI project encompassed the provision of education for EMS personnel about TF-HP-CPR with mock code evaluations. The protocol incorporated a newly designated blind insertion airway device and integrated the routine monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) values. The QI project also introduced postresuscitation attempt report cards that were completed by the team leader at the conclusion of each CPR event. A random 16-week sample of patients with OHCA just before implementation of the QI project was analyzed and compared with patients who experienced an OHCA event within a 16-week period after implementation of the TF-HP-CPR protocol. The preimplementation group had 13 patients compared with 11 patients in the postimplementation group. The rate of ROSC in the preimplementation group was 38.46% compared with 54.55% in the postimplementation group. Although the rate of ROSC increased by 16.09%, the findings were not statistically significant (p = 0.6824) and were perceived to be likely due to the small sample sizes. The implementation of a TF-HP-CPR protocol improved the rate of ROSC among patients with OHCA; however, the findings were not statistically significant. A more extensive study is essential for further evaluation."

While intra-arrest ultrasound is increasingly implemented into the advanced life support, we realized a pre-hospital clinical study to evaluate whether the degree of compression of the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) induced by chest compressions during CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and measured by transthoracic echocardiography correlates with the levels of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO ) measured at the time of echocardiographic investigation. Thirty consecutive patients resuscitated for OHCA were included in the study. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed from a subcostal view during ongoing chest compressions in all of them. This was repeated three times during CPR in each patient, and EtCO  levels were registered. From each investigation, a video loop was recorded. Afterwards, maximal and minimal diameters of LV and RV were obtained from the recorded loops and the compression index of LV (LVCI) and RV (RVCI) was calculated as (maximal - minimal/maximal diameter) × 100. Maximal compression index (CImax) defined as the value of LVCI or RVCI, whichever was greater was also assessed. Correlations between EtCO  and LVCI, RVCI, and CImax were expressed as Spearman's correlation coefficient (r). Evaluable echocardiographic records were found in 18 patients, and a total of 52 measurements of all parameters were obtained. Chest compressions induced significant compressions of all observed cardiac cavities (LVCI = 20.6 ± 13.8%, RVCI = 34.5 ± 21.6%, CImax = 37.4 ± 20.2%). We identified positive correlation of EtCO  with LVCI (r = 0.672, p < 0.001) and RVCI (r = 0.778, p < 0.001). The strongest correlation was between EtCO2 and CImax (r = 0.859, p < 0.001). We identified that a CImax cut-off level of 17.35% predicted to reach an EtCO  level > 20 mmHg with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Evaluable echocardiographic records were reached in most of the patients. EtCO  positively correlated with all parameters under consideration, while the strongest correlation was found between CImax and EtCO . Therefore, CImax is a candidate parameter for the guidance of hemodynamic-directed CPR. ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03852225 . Registered 21 February 2019 - Retrospectively registered."

This was a prospective case control study utilizing Atatürk University’s database of adult nontraumatic patients (over 18 years old) with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) over the course of a year. The neurological status of the patients was evaluated after 1 h at ROSC and at hospital discharge, as defined by the cerebral performance category score. The blood gas parameters pH, PO2, PCO2, lactate, and BE were compared with EtCO2 from capnography and arteriol/alveolar carbon dioxide difference (AaDCO2) by using both blood gas and capnography upon admission to the emergency department and at ROSC. A total of 155 patients were included in the study to form the control group with ROSC. The PO2, PCO2, and AaDCO2 values showed a prognostic marker for the supply of ROSC (P < 0.05). The EtCO2,lactate, and BE values measured by the blood gas were found to be insignificant in the prediction of ROSC (P > 0.05). Conversely, AaDCO2 was found to be significant in ROSC estimation (P < 0.05), but not in neurological evaluation (P > 0.05). Blood gas parameters and EtCO2 are sufficient in predicting ROSC. The value of AaDCO2 calculated using EtCO2 and PO2may be used in predicting the prognosis of OHCA patients, but this value does not provide any conclusions concerning neurological survival."

Nevertheless, few studies have investigated its maximum value in different etiologies.   It was a retrospective, observational, multicentre study from the French OHCA Registry. All adult OHCA with a known maximum value of ETCO  during CPR were included. The primary end-point was to determine the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the maximum value of ETCO  during resuscitation for the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).   Of the 53,048 eligible subjects from 2011 to 2018, ETCO  was known in 32,249 subjects (61%). Among them, there were 9.2% of traumatic OHCA, 37.7% of suspected cardiac etiology and 16.4% of suspected respiratory etiology. The AUROC of maximum value of ETCO  during CPR to achieve ROSC was 0.887 95CI [0.875-0.898] in traumatic OHCA, 0.772 95CI [0.765-0.780] in suspected cardiac etiology and 0.802 95CI [0.791-0.812] in suspected respiratory etiology. The threshold with no survivors at d-30 was <10 mmHg for traumatic etiologies and <6 mmHg for suspected cardiac and respiratory causes. The probability of ROSC increased with the value of ETCO  in the 3 etiologies studied.   The maximum value of ETCO  during OHCA resuscitation was strongly associated with ROSC, especially in the case of a traumatic cause. This suggests that a single elevated ETCO  value, regardless of time, could help to predict the outcome."

In total 514 shocks from 214 OHCA patients (75 first shocks) were analysed. For each shock three predictors of defibrillation success were automatically calculated from the device files: two VF-waveform features, amplitude spectrum area (AMSA) and fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), and the median EtCO  (MEtCO ) in the minute before the shock. Sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated, for each predictor individually and for the combination of MEtCO  and VF-waveform predictors. Separate analyses were done for first shocks and all shocks. MEtCO  in first shocks was significantly higher for successful than for unsuccessful shocks (31mmHg/25mmHg, p<0.05), but differences were not significant for all shocks (32mmHg/29mmHg, p>0.05). MEtCO  predicted shock success with an AUC of 0.66 for first shocks, but was not a predictor for all shocks (AUC 0.54). AMSA and FuzzyEn presented AUCs of 0.76 and 0.77 for first shocks, and 0.75 and 0.75 for all shocks. For first shocks, adding MEtCO  improved the AUC of AMSA and FuzzyEn to 0.79 and 0.83, respectively. MEtCO  predicted defibrillation success only for first shocks. Adding MEtCO  to VF-waveform analysis in first shocks improved prediction of shock success. VF-waveform features and MEtCO  were automatically calculated from the device files, so these methods could be introduced in current defibrillators adding only new software."
"30253228","Impact of pre-hospital vital parameters on the neurological outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: Results from the French National Cardiac Arrest Registry.","The targets for vital parameters following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are based on studies carried out predominantly in intensive care units. Therefore, we studied the pre-hospital phase. We included all adult OHCA from the French OHCA Registry. Vital parameters [peripheral oxygen saturation level (SpO ), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO ) and systolic blood pressure (SBP)] documented during the pre-hospital phase by mobile medical team, were evaluated with regard to the neurological outcome on day 30 (classified as good for Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 - 2, and poor for CPC 3 - 5 or death). When compared with a reference range of 94-98%, SpO  values less than 94% were associated with a worse outcome on univariate analysis [relative risk (RR) = 1.108(1.069 - 1.147)]. An SpO  of 99 - 100% did not appear to be harmful [RR = 0.9851(0.956-1.015)]. ETCO  values that deviated from the reference of 30 - 40 mmHg were associated with a worse outcome on univariate analysis [<20, RR = 1.191(1.143 - 1.229); 20 - 29, RR = 1.092(1.061 - 1.123); 41 - 50, RR = 1.075(1.039 - 1.110); >50, RR = 1.136(1.085 - 1.179)]. When compared with a reference range of 100 - 130, higher or lower values of SBP were associated with a worse outcome on univariate analysis [<80, RR = 1.203(1.158 - 1.243); 80 - 99, RR = 1.069(1.033 - 1.105); 131 - 160, RR = 1.076(1.043 - 1.110); >160, RR = 1.168(1.126 - 1.208)]. The multivariate analysis yielded similar results. In comatose patients who have achieved ROSC after OHCA, vital parameters in the pre-hospital phase appear to have a real impact on the 30-day neurological outcome. We found that an SpO  ≥ 94%, an ETCO  of 30 - 40 mmHg, and an SBP of 100 - 130 mmHg were associated with a better prognosis."
"29769232","End-tidal carbon dioxide output in manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation versus active compression-decompression device during prehospital quality controlled resuscitation: a case series study.","Active compression-decompression (ACD) devices have enhanced end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO ) output in experimental cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) studies. However, the results in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients have shown inconsistent outcomes, and earlier studies lacked quality control of CPR attempts. We compared manual CPR with ACD-CPR by measuring ETCO  output using an audiovisual feedback defibrillator to ensure continuous high quality resuscitation attempts. 10 witnessed OHCAs were resuscitated, rotating a 2 min cycle with manual CPR and a 2 min cycle of ACD-CPR. Patients were intubated and the ventilation rate was held constant during CPR. CPR quality parameters and ETCO  values were collected continuously with the defibrillator. Differences in ETCO  output between manual CPR and ACD-CPR were analysed using a linear mixed model where ETCO  output produced by a summary of the 2 min cycles was included as the dependent variable, the patient as a random factor and method as a fixed effect. These comparisons were made within each OHCA case to minimise confounding factors between the cases. Mean length of the CPR episodes was 37 (SD 8) min. Mean compression depth was 76 (SD 1.3) mm versus 71 (SD1.0) mm, and mean compression rate was 100 per min (SD 6.7) versus 105 per min (SD 4.9) between ACD-CPR and manual CPR, respectively. For ETCO  output, the interaction between the method and the patient was significant (P<0.001). ETCO  output was higher with manual CPR in 6 of the 10 cases. This study suggests that quality controlled ACD-CPR is not superior to quality controlled manual CPR when ETCO  is used as a quantitative measure of CPR effectiveness. NCT00951704; Results."
"29175355","An assessment of ventilation and perfusion markers in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients receiving mechanical CPR with endotracheal or supraglottic airways.","Mechanical chest compression (MCPR) devices are considered equivalent to manual compressions in patient outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, recent data suggest possible harm in patients with a supraglottic airway device (SGA) during MCPR. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in direct and indirect markers of ventilation and perfusion in patients with cardiac arrest receiving MCPR and who had their airway managed with an endotracheal tube (ETT) or SGA. We retrospectively reviewed Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agencies and emergency department (ED) records over a two-year period. We included patients with OHCA who underwent MCPR and who had an advanced airway placed. The primary outcome was differences in intra-arrest end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) measurements. Secondary outcomes included intra-arrest ventilation rates, rates of prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), blood pressure upon prehospital ROSC, and 24-h survival. Valid data sets were available for 126 patients. Eighty-four (66.7%) had an ETT placed, and 42 (33.3%) had a SGA placed. Twenty-eight (22.6%) achieved prehospital ROSC. Twenty-four-hour survival data were available for 13 (10.3%) of these patients. There were no significant differences in primary or secondary outcomes. In this retrospective study, we found no evidence of differences in markers of ventilation, perfusion or prehospital ROSC and survival in patients with OHCA who had their airway managed with either an ETT or SGA while receiving MCPR."
"28847626","System.Xml.XmlElement","Both end tidal CO  (ETCO ) and cerebral oxygen saturations (rSO ) have been studied to determine their ability to monitor the effectiveness of CPR and predict return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). We compared the accuracy of ETCO  and rSO  at predicting ROSC in ED patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We performed a prospective, observational study of adult ED patients presenting in cardiac arrest. We collected demographic and clinical data including age, gender, presenting rhythm, rSO , and ETCO . We used receiver operating characteristic curves to compare how well rSO  and ETCO  predicted ROSC. 225 patients presented to the ED with cardiac arrest between 10/11 and 10/14 of which 100 had both rSO  and ETCO  measurements. Thirty three patients (33%) had sustained ROSC, only 2 survived to discharge. The AUCs for rSO  and ETCO  were similar (0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.80] and 0.77 [95% CI, 0.68-0.86], respectively), however, rSO  and ETCO  were poorly correlated (0.12, 95% CI, -0.08-0.31). The optimal cutoffs for rSO  and ETCO  were 50% and 20mm Hg respectively. At these cutoffs, ETCO  was more sensitive (100%, 95% CI 87-100 vs. 48%, 31-66) but rSO  was more specific (85%, 95% CI, 74-92 vs. 45%, 33-57). While poorly correlated, rSO  and ETCO  have similar diagnostic characteristics. ETCO  is more sensitive and rSO  is more specific at predicting ROSC in OHCA."

"26948821","Prognostication of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients by 3-min end-tidal capnometry level in emergency department.","To evaluate the role of initial ETCO2 value in prognostication of OHCA patients in an Asian-Chinese cohort. Prospective cohort study. Emergency departments of two regional hospitals in a cluster of Hong Kong. Patients were recruited prospectively from the local cardiac arrest registry from July 2012 to June 2013. Patients of non traumatic OHCA aged ≥18 years old were included. Patients of OHCA presented with postmortem changes, those who decided for Do Not Resuscitate (DNR), regained pulse before arrival, or those without proper documentation of ETCO2 would be excluded. Primary outcome was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). A 3-min ETCO2 >10mmHg was a predictor of ROSC with OR 18.16 (95% CI 4.79-51.32, p<0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of 3-min ETCO2 >10mmHg to predict ROSC: sensitivity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.89-0.98) while the specificity was 0.27 (95% CI 0.21-0.33). Positive predictive value was 0.40 (95% CI 0.34-0.46) while negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.92 (95% CI 0.82-0.97). Area under ROC curve of 3-min ETCO2 predicting ROSC was 0.80 (95% CI 0.71-0.91). A 3-min ETCO2 ≤10mmHg was associated with poor prognosis and low chance of ROSC. Low ETCO2 level may have a role to reduce prolonged medically futile resuscitation."
"26830353","Association between Prehospital CPR Quality and End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide Levels in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.","International Guidelines recommend measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) to enhance cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) quality and optimize blood flow during CPR. Numerous factors impact EtCO2 (e.g., ventilation, metabolism, cardiac output), yet few clinical studies have correlated CPR quality and EtCO2 during actual out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resuscitations. The purpose of this study was to describe the association between EtCO2 and CPR quality variables during OHCA. This is an observational study of prospectively collected CPR quality and capnography data from two EMS agencies participating in a statewide resuscitation quality improvement program. CPR quality and capnography data from adult (≥18 years) cardiac resuscitation attempts (10/2008-06/2013) were collected and analyzed on a minute-by-minute basis using RescueNet™ Code Review. Linear mixed effect models were used to evaluate the association between (log-transformed) EtCO2 level and CPR variables: chest compression (CC) depth, CC rate, CC release velocity (CCRV), ventilation rate. Among the 1217 adult OHCA cases of presumed cardiac etiology, 925 (76.0%) had a monitor-defibrillator file with CPR quality data, of which 296 (32.0%) cases had >1 minute of capnography data during CPR. After capnography quality review, 66 of these cases (22.3%) were excluded due to uninterpretable capnography, resulting in a final study sample of 230 subjects (mean age 68 years; 69.1% male), with a total of 1581 minutes of data. After adjustment for other CPR variables, a 10 mm increase in CC depth was associated with a 4.0% increase in EtCO2 (p < 0.0001), a 10 compression/minute increase in CC rate with a 1.7% increase in EtCO2 (p = 0.02), a 10 mm/second increase in CCRV with a 2.8% increase in EtCO2 (p = 0.03), and a 10 breath/minute increase in ventilation rate with a 17.4% decrease in EtCO2 (p < 0.0001). When controlling for known CPR quality variables, increases in CC depth, CC rate and CCRV were each associated with a statistically significant but clinically modest increase in EtCO2. Given the small effect sizes, the clinical utility of using EtCO2 to guide CPR performance is unclear. Further research is needed to determine the practicality and impact of using real-time EtCO2 to guide CPR delivery in the prehospital environment."
"26597847","End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring may be associated with a higher possibility of return of spontaneous circulation during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a population-based study.","During cardiac arrest, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) monitoring is recommended as a chest compression performance indicator. However, its frequency of use during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and its benefits have never been evaluated in real clinical situations. We investigated OHCA patients in Taiwan to evaluate the frequency of ETCO2 monitoring and its effects on sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). We sampled the Taiwan National Health Insurance claims database, which contains 1 million beneficiaries. All adult beneficiaries older than 18 years who presented with OHCA and received chest compression between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2012 were enrolled. We further identified patients with ETCO2 monitoring and matched each 1 with 20 patients who did not receive ETCO2 monitoring based on their propensity scores. A simple conditional logistic regression model was applied to compare the odds ratio (OR) for sustained ROSC in the matched cohorts. A total of 5041 OHCA patients were enrolled. The frequency of ETCO2 monitoring has increased since 2010 but still is low. After matching, 53 patients with ETCO2 monitoring and 1060 without ETCO2 monitoring were selected. The OR of sustained ROSC in the ETCO2 group was significantly increased (2.38, 95 % CI 1.28-4.42). Patients who received ETCO2 monitoring during OHCA had a higher possibility of sustained ROSC, but the overall use of ETCO2 monitoring is still low despite strong recommendations for its use."
"25898992","Quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest before and after introduction of a mechanical chest compression device, LUCAS-2; a prospective, observational study.","Mechanical chest compressions have been proposed to provide high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but despite the growing use of mechanical chest compression devices, only few studies have addressed their impact on CPR quality. This study aims to evaluate mechanical chest compressions provided by LUCAS-2 (Lund University Cardiac Assist System) compared with manual chest compression in a cohort of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) cases. In this prospective study conducted in the Central Denmark Region, Denmark, the emergency medical service attempted resuscitation and reported data on 696 non-traumatic OHCA patients between April 2011 and February 2013. Of these, 155 were treated with LUCAS CPR after an episode with manual CPR. The CPR quality was evaluated using transthoracic impedance measurements collected from the LIFEPAK 12 defibrillator, and the effect was assessed in terms of chest compression rate, no-flow time and no-flow fraction; the fraction of time during resuscitation in which the patient is without spontaneous circulation receiving no chest compression. The median total episode duration was 21 minutes, and the episode with LUCAS CPR was significantly longer than the manual CPR episode, 13 minutes vs. 5 minutes, p < 0.001. The no-flow fraction was significantly lower during LUCAS CPR (16%) than during manual CPR (35%); difference 19% (95% CI: 16% to 21%; p < 0.001). No differences were found in pre- and post-shock no-flow time throughout manual CPR and LUCAS CPR. Contrary to the manual CPR, the average compression rate during LUCAS CPR was in conformity with the current Guidelines for Resuscitation, 102/minute vs. 124/minute, p < 0.001. Mechanical chest compressions provided by the LUCAS device improve CPR quality by significantly reducing the NFF and by improving the quality of chest compression compared with manual CPR during OHCA resuscitation. However, data on end-tidal Co2 and chest compression depth surrogate parameters of CPR quality could not be reported."
"22370007","Factors complicating interpretation of capnography during advanced life support in cardiac arrest--a clinical retrospective study in 575 patients.","End tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)) monitoring during advanced life support (ALS) using capnography, is recommended in the latest international guidelines. However, several factors might complicate capnography interpretation during ALS. How the cause of cardiac arrest, initial rhythm, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and time impact on the ETCO(2) values are not completely clear. Thus, we wanted to explore this in out-of-hospital cardiac arrested (OHCA) patients. The study was carried out by the Emergency Medical Service of Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. All non-traumatic OHCAs treated by our service between January 2004 and December 2009 were included. Capnography was routinely used in the study, and these data were retrospectively reviewed together with Utstein data and other clinical information. Our service treated 918 OHCA patients, and capnography data were present in 575 patients. Capnography distinguished well between patients with or without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for any initial rhythm and cause of the arrest (p<0.001). Cardiac arrests with a respiratory cause had significantly higher levels of ETCO(2) compared to primary cardiac causes (p<0.001). Bystander CPR affected ETCO(2)-recordings, and the ETCO(2) levels declined with time. Capnography is a useful tool to optimise and individualise ALS in cardiac arrested patients. Confounding factors including cause of cardiac arrest, initial rhythm, bystander CPR and time from cardiac arrest until quantitative capnography had an impact on the ETCO(2) values, thereby complicating and limiting prognostic interpretation of capnography during ALS."
"17161518","Utstein style analysis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest--bystander CPR and end expired carbon dioxide.","The aim of this prospective cohort study was to describe the outcome for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Maribor (Slovenia) over a 4 year period using a modified Utstein style, and to investigate elementary knowledge of basic life support among potential bystanders in our community. Through the prehospital and the hospital database system we followed up a consecutive group of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) between January 2001 and December 2004. We investigated the effects of various factors on outcome in OHCA, especially partial end-tidal CO2 pressure (petCO2), efficacy of bystander CPR and their elementary knowledge of basic life support (BLS). We also examined motivation among potential bystanders and possible implementation for BLS education in our community. OHCA was confirmed in 592 patients. Advanced cardiac life support was initiated in 389 patients, of which 277 were of cardiac aetiology. In 287 patients the event was bystanders witnessed and lay-bystander basic life support was performed only in 83 (23%). After treating OHCA by a physician-based prehospital medical team ROSC was obtained in 61%, the ROSC on admission was 50% and the overall survival to discharge was 21%. Initial petCO2 (OR: 22.04; 95%CI: 11.41-42.55), ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia as initial rhythm (OR: 2.13; 95%CI: 1.17-4.22), bystander CPR (OR: 2.55; 95%CI: 1.13-5.73), female sex (OR: 3.08; 95%CI: 1.49-6.38) and arrival time (OR: 1.29; 95%CI: 1.11-1.82) were associated with improved ROSC when using multivariate analysis. Using the same method we found that bystander CPR (OR: 5.05; 95%CI: 2.24-11.39), witnessed arrest (OR: 9.98; 95%CI: 2.89-34.44), final petCO2 (OR: 2.37; 95%CI: 1.67-3.37), initial petCO2 (OR: 1.61; 95%CI: 1.28-2.64) and arrival time (OR: 1.39; 95%CI: 1.33-1.60) were associated with improved survival. A questionnaire to potential bystanders has revealed disappointing knowledge about BLS fundamentals. On the other side, there is a welcomed willingness of potential bystanders to take BLS training and to follow dispatchers instructions by telephone on how to perform CPR. After OHCA in a physician-based prehospital setting in our region, the overall survival to discharge was 21%. The potential bystander in our community is generally poorly educated in performing CPR, but willing to gain knowledge and skills in BLS and to follow dispatchers instructions. Arrival time, witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, initial petCO2 and final petCO2 were significantly positively related with ROSC on admission and with survival. Prehospital data from this and previous studies provide strong support for a petCO2 of 1.33 kPa to be a resuscitation threshold in the field. In our opinion the initial value of petCO2 should be included in every Utstein style analysis."
"7755196","Prognostic value of end-tidal carbon dioxide pressures during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.","To assess the prognostic value of initial end-tidal CO2 pressures (PETCO2) during CPR in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). A prospective observational study using a convenience sample. Primary service area of an advanced life support (ALS) ambulance service, including a city with a population of 70,745 and the surrounding area, with a population of 30,000. Adults with nontraumatic OHCA. Quantitative monitoring of PETCO2 during CPR after endotracheal intubation using an infrared capnograph. PETCO2 after 1 and 2 minutes and the maximum PETCO2 during CPR were compared between the group in which restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved and the group in which it was not. PETCO2 was measured during CPR in 27 patients. After 1 minute, PETCO2 was higher in patients who had on-scene ROSC than in patients without ROSC (23.0 +/- 7.4 versus 13.2 +/- 14.7 mm Hg, P = .0002). After 2 minutes, PETCO2 was higher in patients with ROSC (26.8 +/- 10.8 versus 15.4 +/- 5.7 mm Hg, P = .0019). The maximum PETCO2 during CPR was also higher in the ROSC group (30.8 +/- 9.5 versus 22.7 +/- 8.8 mm Hg, P = .0154). Thirteen of 27 patients presented in ventricular fibrillation (VF). The 1-minute (24.3 +/- 6.8 versus 12.0 +/- 4.2 mm Hg, P = .0022), 2-minute (28.2 +/- 11.4 versus 12.4 +/- 4.3 mm Hg, P = .0088), and maximum (33.0 +/- 10.2 versus 20.6 +/- 11.1 mm Hg, P = .0316) PETCO2 values during CPR were all significantly higher in patients in VF with ROSC. In this observation study of 27 patients, initial PETCO2 during CPR with automated ventilation was prognostic for ROSC in patients with OHCA. Patients with ROSC have higher PETCO2 values after 1 and 2 minutes than do patients without ROSC."
